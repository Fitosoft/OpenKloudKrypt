# Open Kloud Krypt
Open source tool to transparently encrypt data on any cloud service or even other (network) folder.

Please visit [our Wiki](https://github.com/Fitosoft/OpenKloudKrypt/wiki) for details about this just starting project that should allow users to easily, intuitively and especially transparently encrypt/decrypt specific files stored on a cloud service as DropBox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive or even any any other network resource.
